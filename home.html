          <p>
               Ghana is a nation with several tribes, religions and traditions. All through the northern sphere to the
               southern
               is a wide range
               of several cultures with different traditons and cultural practices.
          </p>
          <p>
               It is very sad the young ones of today know almost nothing about their traditions: traditional, games.
          </p>
          <p>
               Technology in a way is replacing our traditions. Traditions in themselves are treasures in earthen
               vessels, and so
               should
               not be lost. We therefore sought to use Technology to promote the same traditions it is almost replacing
               in our
               daily lives.
          </p>

          <p>
               I remember when we were kids and played games that made us happy and sometimes sad? Now, with phones and
               computers
               everywhere, we don't play like that anymore. Let's think back to those fun times and play those old games
               again.
               Those games were special because they taught us to work together, think carefully, and keep trying. I
               wish my kids
               could play like we did, but now they play with screens instead.
               I hope this post will help people remember the fun times and introduce those games to people who never
               played
               them. Let's make sure our kids know about these classic Ghanaian games too.
               Here's a list of some games we loved when we were young:
          <ul>
               <li>Oware</li>
               <li>Pilolo</li>
               <li>Antoakyire</li>
               <li>Ampe</li>
               <li>Tu Man Tu(hopscotch)</li>
               <li>Day born </li>
               <li>Ma te ma te</li>
               <li>Sansankroma</li>
               <li>Robert </li>
               <li>Baabaabamlika</li>
          </ul>
          </p>

          <p>
               This website is aimed to promote Ghanaian rich cultures and traditions by portraying traditional dances
               and games.
               Surfing through this webiste, one would learn about the different dances and games about different
               cultures in
               Ghana.

               HOW TRADITIONAL DANCES ENHACE THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS
          </h3>

               <P>
                    Ghanaian traditional games can fall under several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), but most
                    directly under:
               <p>
                    <span class="sdg_name"> <strong>SDG 3, Good Health and Well-being:</strong></span>
                    Traditional games promote physical activity, mental well-being, and social interaction, contributing
                    to overall
                    health and well-being.
               </p>
               <p>
                    <span class="sdg_name"> <strong>SDG 4, Quality Education:</strong></span>
                    Traditional games often teach valuable skills, such as strategy, teamwork, and problem-solving,
                    which can
                    complement formal education.
               </p>
               <p>
                    <span class="sdg_name"> <strong>SDG 11, Sustainable Cities and Communities:</strong></span>
                    Traditional games can foster community engagement, social cohesion, and cultural heritage,
                    contributing to
                    sustainable and inclusive communities.
               </p>
               <p>
                    <span class="sdg_name"><strong>SDG 17, Partnerships for the Goals:</strong></span>
                    Revitalizing traditional games can involve partnerships between communities, organizations, and
                    governments to
                    preserve cultural heritage and promote sustainable development.
               </p>      
               <p>
                    <strong>
                         These SDGs align with the benefits of traditional games, including physical activity, social
                         interaction,
                         education, and cultural preservation.
